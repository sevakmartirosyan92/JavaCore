Sport is an essential part of my daily life.
Every morning all the year round I do morning exercises.
Almost every day I do some training.
In summer I go swimming and rowing.
Usually I spend my winter holidays in the country where I ski, skate or toboggan.
Russian people have always paid much attention to sport.
Sport keeps people fit and healthy and makes them better disciplined in their daily activities.
